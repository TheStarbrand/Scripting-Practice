This project is just helping me practice my scripting skills
Assumptions:
- data directories used contain multiple files and directories
- we are only concerned with files located in this directory
- each file is stored in a directory that contains the word "game"
- each file directory contains a single .go file that has to be compiled before

Project steps:
- Find all the game directories from /data
- Create a new /games directory
- Copy and remove the "game" suffix of all games 
- Create a .json file with the info about the games
- Compile all the game code 
- Run all of the game code
